# What is the USBIPManager?
The traditional connection of the USB device requires direct physical action, but the USBIP project has relieved us from this. Nevertheless, he did not save us from the routine console actions that had to be performed to mount the device into the system successfully. Thus, the USBIPManager is designed to automate operations when working with the USBIP.
